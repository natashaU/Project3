## Description:
 This app will view an image and render results based off the persons facial expression using Algorithmia API. 

## UX/UI / User Stories    
 The landing page will display the title of the app at the top. A user will enter a url at the form page. Also, on the landing page is a link to the about page that will explain everything about the app. After submitting an image the computer will show the results of RBF score from 0 to 10, 10 being the maximum score. After the image is shown there will also be questions that ask the user if they are happy and if they agree to submit the results to the API developers. After viewing the results the user can pick a different image to get results for.
